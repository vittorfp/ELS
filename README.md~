# Early-Life Seizure - Signal analysis

This repo contains the scripts used so far to make the data analysis of the Early-life Seizure experiment made by Rafael Ruggiero at FMRP-USP (CEUA 159/2014).

The subjects are Wistar Rats submitted to *status epilepticus* at early live, when adults, they were implanted with electrodes in the Hippocampus and Prefrontal Cortex and had the LFP recorded for 24 hours.
